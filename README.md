# dtgeostats

The **dtgeostats** package is a hodge-podge of utilities for working with different geostatistical packages. It was mainly developed for creating input parameter files for *impala* (Straubhaar et al., 2011), *DeeSse* (Mariethoz et al., 2010), and *GCOSIM3D* (Gómez-Hernández & Journel, 1993) simulation tools, with some utilities for converting data into ``.gslib`` formats and performing normal-score transforms.

The repository was developed during my doctoral studies and as such is not being actively maintained, and is still a construction site in places. I have posted it on github as it could be a good starting point for others wrapping their geostatistical toys in python. Feel free to get in touch should you have any questions (jeremypaulbennett@gmail.com).
